# Tasty Basic Files

## Introduction
The CP/M version of Tasty Basic allows programs to be saved to and loaded from disk. This
document describes the Tasty Basic `.TBA` file format.

## .TBA File format
Tasty Basic `.TBA` files are direct reflections of Tasty Basic programs as held in memory. Thus,
each line of code starts with a 16 bit, LSB first, line number and ends with a carriage return
character (0xD). An EOF marker (0x1A) indicates the end of the file. Any trailing NUL characters
(0x0) are ignored.

### Example
Following is an example Tasty Basic program:
```
10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
20 GOTO 10
```
And its `.TBA` file representation:
```
B>dump hello.tba ↵

0000 0A 00 50 52 49 4E 54 20 22 48 45 4C 4C 4F 20 57
0010 4F 52 4C 44 22 0D 14 00 47 4F 54 4F 20 31 30 0D
